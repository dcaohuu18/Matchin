What is it?

Matchin is a website that allows everyone to become commentators of football matches. Besides, it is also a website specializing in football. (See more in basic features)

Why do I come up with this idea?

1/Because I find myself bored with the commentators on TV. They are all men and all follow the same style of commentating. Some of them speak with a sleepy drawl and in some cases, their commentary is biased. That's why I come up with the idea of providing viewers with a wider variety of choices. I do that by giving everybody the chance of becoming football commentators.

2/I believe commentating on a match is a new way of enjoying football because it deepens the connection between the viewers and the match. When you commentate on a match, you follow every single move of it, you feel as if you were also a part of the twenty two players on the field, you live with it FULLY!

3/I believe that everyone has the desire of becoming well-known. Being a football commentator who are watched by thousands of viewers? Not a bad idea to me.
